# gaussian-filter-performance-analysis
This repository contains a Python script to analyze and compare the performance of applying Gaussian filters using OpenCV. It evaluates two methods: a 2D Gaussian filter and two sequential 1D Gaussian filters, across varying image sizes and kernel sizes. The results are saved into CSV files for easy analysis.
